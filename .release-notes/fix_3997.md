## Don't allow FFI calls in default methods or behaviors

In Pony, when you `use` an external library, you import the public types defined by that library. An exception to this rule is FFI declarations: any FFI declarations in a library will not be visible by external users. Given that the compiler only allows a single FFI declaration per package for any given function, if external FFI declarations were imported, deciding which declaration to use would be ambiguous.

When added to the fact that every FFI function must have a matching declaration, a consequence of not importing external declarations is that if a library contains a public interface or trait with default methods (or behaviors), by performing an FFI call on those methods will render them unusable to external consumers.

Consider the following code:

```pony
// src/lib/lib.pony
use @printf[I32](fmt: Pointer[None] tag, ...)

trait Foo
  fun apply() =>
    @printf("Hello from trait Foo\n".cstring())

// src/main.pony
use "./lib"

actor Main is Foo
  new create(env: Env) =>
    this.apply()
```

Up until ponyc 0.49.1, the above failed to compile, because `main.pony` never defined an FFI declaration for `printf`. One way of making the above code compile is by moving the call to `@printf` to a separate type:

```pony
// src/lib/lib.pony
use @printf[I32](fmt: Pointer[None] tag, ...)

trait Foo
  fun apply() =>
    Printf("Hello from interface Foo\n")

primitive Printf
  fun apply(str: String) =>
    @printf(str.cstring())

// src/main.pony
use "./lib"

actor Main is Foo
  new create(env: Env) =>
    this.apply()
```

Given that the original error is not immediately obvious, starting from this release, it is now a compile error to call FFI functions in default methods (or behaviors). However, this means that code that used to be legal will now fail with a compiler error. For example:

```pony
use @printf[I32](fmt: Pointer[None] tag, ...)

actor Main is _PrivateFoo
  new create(env: Env) =>
    this.apply()

trait _PrivateFoo
  fun apply() =>
    // Error: can't call an FFI function in a default method or behavior.
    @printf("Hello from private trait _PrivateFoo\n".cstring())
```

Like mentioned above, to fix the code above, you will need to move any FFI calls to external function:

```pony
use @printf[I32](fmt: Pointer[None] tag, ...)

actor Main is _PrivateFoo
  new create(env: Env) =>
    this.apply()

trait _PrivateFoo
  fun apply() =>
    // OK
    Printf("Hello from private trait _PrivateFoo\n")

primitive Printf
  fun apply(str: String) =>
    @printf(str.cstring())
```

We believe that the impact of this change should be small, given the usability problems outlined above.
